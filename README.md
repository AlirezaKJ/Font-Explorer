## Overview
Font Explorer is a tool that facilitates designers, typographers, and front-end developers to view and compare diverse fonts, whether they are local or provided by Font Explorer. This software is an open-source project, which means users can contribute to its development and report any issues they encounter while using it. Users can view fonts in various styles, including condensed and italic modes, small caps, and different weights. Moreover, changing the weight of one text content automatically changes others as well, making it easier for users to experiment with different font styles.

To access local fonts installed on a user's computer, users can simply rename the font title in the opened font tab to the name of the locally installed font. This feature provides users with a hassle-free experience when viewing local fonts, thus making the software more efficient and user-friendly.

In addition, the glyph section of the font tab provides access to a wide range of glyphs, including Latin lowercase, Latin uppercase, Greek lowercase, Greek uppercase, Cyrillic lowercase, Cyrillic uppercase, Hebrew, numbers, common Latin, punctuation, and currency symbols. This feature is particularly useful for designers and typographers who need to access different glyphs for their work.

Fonts provided by Font Explorer are variable fonts and open source, included in the Google and Adobe font libraries. Most of them are licensed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) and Apache License, Version 2.0. This means that users can use and modify these fonts for personal and commercial use without any legal issues.

Therefore, Font Explorer is a powerful tool that provides designers, typographers, and front-end developers with a range of features and functions to facilitate their work with fonts. With its open-source nature, users can contribute to its development and make it even better for future users.
